`Note`: Use `Python 3.12.0` in a newly created virtual environment to avoid dlt installation errors (i.e. with Python 3.13.0). As on 18.02.2024


# What is dlt
**dlt** stands for `data load tool ` and it is a library for `data ingestion`.
Note: DBT is specifically a `transformation tool` within an ETL process.

## **What is data ingestion?**  
Data ingestion is the process of **extracting** data from a source, transporting it to a suitable environment, and preparing it for use. This often includes **normalizing**, **cleaning**, and **adding metadata**.

---

## **Data pipelines **  
They ensure data flows seamlessly from its source to its final destination
